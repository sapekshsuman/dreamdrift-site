    <h1>DreamDrift Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 11, 2026</p>

    <p>DreamDrift ("we", "our", or "the app") is a sleep sounds and white noise application. This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <h3>Data stored locally on your device</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>App preferences:</strong> Your selected default timer duration, favorite sounds, and saved mixes are stored locally on your device using a local database. This data never leaves your device.</li>
        <li><strong>Premium purchase status:</strong> Your premium subscription or purchase status is stored locally and verified through Google Play Billing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Data collected by third-party services</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google AdMob:</strong> We display ads to free-tier users. Google AdMob may collect device identifiers, IP addresses, and ad interaction data to serve relevant ads. See <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Google Play Billing:</strong> In-app purchases are processed through Google Play. We do not have access to your payment information. See <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Firebase Analytics (if enabled):</strong> We may use Firebase Analytics to understand app usage patterns such as which sounds are most popular and how the timer feature is used. This data is anonymized and aggregated. See <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy">Firebase Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Firebase Crashlytics (if enabled):</strong> We may collect crash reports to improve app stability. These reports include device type, OS version, and stack traces but do not include personal information.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Information We Do NOT Collect</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>We do not collect your name, email address, or any personal contact information.</li>
        <li>We do not collect location data.</li>
        <li>We do not record or access your microphone or camera.</li>
        <li>We do not share any personal data with third parties beyond what is described above.</li>
        <li>All audio playback is fully offline — no sound data is streamed or transmitted.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Advertising</h2>
    <p>Free-tier users see ads served by Google AdMob. Premium users do not see any ads. You can upgrade to premium at any time through the app's settings to remove all advertising.</p>
    <p>Google AdMob may use cookies and device identifiers to personalize ads. You can manage your ad preferences through your device's settings or Google's ad settings at <a href="https://adssettings.google.com">adssettings.google.com</a>.</p>

    <h2>In-App Purchases</h2>
    <p>DreamDrift offers optional premium upgrades (lifetime purchase or monthly subscription) through Google Play Billing. All payment processing is handled by Google. We do not store or have access to your credit card or payment details.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>DreamDrift is suitable for all ages. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. The app does not require any user accounts or personal data input.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>All app preferences and saved mixes are stored locally on your device. Uninstalling the app removes all locally stored data. Third-party services (AdMob, Firebase) have their own data retention policies.</p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Since we store data locally on your device, you have full control over your data. You can:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Clear app data through your device's settings</li>
        <li>Uninstall the app to remove all local data</li>
        <li>Opt out of personalized ads through your device's ad settings</li>
        <li>Upgrade to premium to disable all advertising</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected by updating the "Last updated" date at the top of this page.</p>
